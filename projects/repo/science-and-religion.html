            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Prior to the 19th century, religion was not a practice separated from science. 
            Even the terms, “science” and “religion”, were not standardized yet (De Cruz, 2019). 
            Only in the 19th century when people advanced in their discoveries about the world did they began dismissing religion 
            and separating it from science. One of the main events that lead to that was emergence of the theory of evolution 
            (Darwin, 1859) which challenged the idea of creationism. Other philosophers and scientists disregarded religion as well. 
            Comte (1853), for example, said that religion is the result of the primitive need for questions that could not be 
            answered at the time, Nietzsche (1974) said that religion was created by the poor people to satisfy themselves by 
            making their miseries seem meaningful, and Freud (1961) said that the belief in God results from a subconscious 
            wish for a perfect father figure. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            One of the points that religion and science clash is in whether humans were created by an intelligent design or 
            are the outcome of a long process of evolution. Holders of the creationist belief may argue that a theory is just a guess, 
            but ever since the emergence of the theory of evolution, so much evidence that supports the theory has been progressively 
            discovered that the question is no longer “did the evolution happen?” but “how did the evolution happen?”. The contemporary 
            historian Harari (2018) writes that humans gradually extended their consciousness and their ability to think until they 
            started questioning their own existence, and so they came up with the idea of God, but now that we know about the theory 
            of evolution, we can give up the belief in God and think more realistically. Another point of clash is the idea of 
            determinism and free will. Most religious beliefs say that humans are free and are independent of the physical causality, 
            so God will judge them for their free decisions. The neuroscientist Eagleman (2015) writes that even though our decisions 
            are not completely predictable (only because they are too complex), we are not free. Our decisions are the outcome of 
            neural interactions which are subject to physical causality and which we are unaware of.            
            <br><br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
              <p class="mb-0"><em>"[Science and religion] can be compatible when religious texts is taken metaphorically instead of straightforwardly."</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            However, with all the seemingly clashing ideas, religion and science can still be compatible. 
            The psychologist Allport (1950) writes that it can be true that religious beliefs might be the outcome of 
            primitive naiveness – the people’s appeal for easy answers, of people’s immaturity or their need for 
            belonging and making groups, but, he writes, these traits (appeal for easy answers, immaturity, and need for 
            belonging to groups) are in the nature of each person, including atheists, and it does not invalidate religion itself. 
            Furthermore, even if the belief in God comes from childishness or weakness, it can be developed into a 
            mature philosophy of life when the person has acquired three traits: the ability to rise above the level of 
            immediate biological impulses, the ability to objectify oneself and be open to ideas and beliefs opposing one’s own, 
            and the ability to unify one’s own philosophy of life and be coherent. A book by National Academy of Sciences 
            (2008) explains that the two can be compatible when religious texts is taken metaphorically instead of straightforwardly. 
            For example, creation can be a metaphor for evolution, heaven and hell can be metaphors for the reward and 
            punishment that people reap while they are still alive for actions they have done, resurrection can be a metaphor 
            for death, and God can be a metaphor for the good, mature, and guiding self that is inside each person.

    <!-- Thinkathon is the sub-project of the
        assembly which gathers young people to discuss the cultural, economic,
        global problems and also the problems that youth of today is challenging
        and to talk the solutions that can be brought to them by the actions of
        young communities. Beyond that, the possible resolutions that today’s
        rule makers should  have for the discussed problems is being talked in
        the second step. The topic which is being discussed in this session are
        mostly related to the previous speech\ presentations. In the end of each
        session, the co-managers write down the highlights of the discussion and
        the resolutions which are found by the participants. The co-managers
        publish the notes that have been taken as the reports on the website
        ,which will be established soon, and also on the social platforms. -->
