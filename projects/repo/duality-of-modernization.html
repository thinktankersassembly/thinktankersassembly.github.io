            Everything in life exists with its opposite and is in balance with its antithesis. This applies to all human-generated and human-independent systems. 
            The theory of modernization that man has developed, affected, and been influenced by is also a part of this balance of contradictions. 
            The duality of both, the constituents of the modernization and the changes in the fields it affects give it a paradoxical identity. In other words, the modernization theory is a coin with two different sides. The book Paradoxes of Modernization explicates modernization and the realms it influenced in all its dimensions and the paradoxes it contains, therefore I benefited from this book, explaining the dual structure of modernization in this article. It is essential to define the concepts of modernization and paradox in order to better understand the aforementioned issues which I will elaborate on later. According to the authors of the book, Hans Van Der Loo and Willem Van Reijen, modernization was defined as a social change without fixed patterns. In the later chapters, modernity is also described as a visual phenomenon felt all over the world, and the paradox is what goes against our logical understanding, the contradiction. The paradoxical character of modernization is not a new concept that emerged with the publication of this book, but a phenomenon previously mentioned by social scientists. The concept of modernization, which I mentioned as concretized as a visual phenomenon, is used in different concepts and forms by different circles. These visual phenomena have penetrated a wide range from technology and music genres to lifestyle and these innovations that have entered our lives are considered as modern. It is also important to point out that in social sciences, modernization theory is used in relation to the historical development of western society.

            In modern societies, production originated from the market while urbanization is derived from the capitalist mindset. Modernization, which prioritizes individualism rather than a holistic structure and emphasizes rationality in thoughts and actions and includes socioeconomic changes, is a reality that occurs in the historical process. Modernization, in its simplest terms, expresses the opposite tendency of the traditional and the new as modern and non-modern. At the same time modernization includes urbanization, the decline of religion, the advanced rationalization of thought and action, progressive democratization and diminishing social differences, extreme individualism, and many other economic, social, political, and cultural changes. Unlike classical thinkers who argue that the influence of modernization takes place simultaneously and at the same speed and attribute a value to modernity, social theorists such as Hans van der Loo and Wiilem van Reijen opposed this old-fashioned idea by explaining through the example of Japan, which has a traditional culture and is also partially and selectively modernized in the industrial area. These social theorists explained the four basic paradoxical planes of the modernization process as "differentiation", "rationalization", "individualization" and "domestication" and argued that modernization was a combination of these four processes. These processes have modernization resulting in the occurrence of its contradictions which I will explain in the following sentences.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The paradox of differentiation can be explained with the example of differentiation and integration. With modernization, the rise in the division of labor and specialization, and the cooperation of many more people compared to the past, and the division of existing social units into different parts where each part has a unique function has created a need for integration. Integration between units is essential since specialization as a part of the differentiation process cannot meet the needs of the society unless there is cooperation. The idea of equality of all people, which is a result of modernization, has resulted in the birth of a new inequality in individuals' typicalness. On the other hand, differentiation has caused the modern individual to become part of another standardization in a reality where all human beings are supposed to be equal, in ways he uses to preserve his own originality. An example of this is that individuals seek status for themselves in the field of consumption and satisfy their desire to remain authentic until everyone applies the same preferences.
            Another element of modernization's dual identity is the individualization paradox which we correlate with Tocqueville's narrative of the relation between the state and individualism in the light of modernization. Basically, individuals will pursue their own interests as a result of individualization and therefore will not be able to control politics. As the public sector will gain strength over time due to the aforementioned reason, the state will start to regulate and control everything. Even if the individual assumes that as a result of individualization, he will become a more free and uninterrupted entity, he will need a strong state to survive at the end of the day. Therefore individualized society needs a strong state, and a strong state consequently limits the individual's freedom. So as the individualization increases, the individual's need for the state will increase too and by that time the state will have more domination over the individual.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            In the plane of the rationalization that explains the cultural dimension of modernization, I would like to mention about the process that Max Weber calls "Entzauberung", that is, "the disenchantment of the world." In Weber's words, the pre-modern world is a magical world where pleasant surprises and threats are constantly shifting. With modernization, man left this mysterious world and entered a rational universe where everything is planned and calculated. To sum up, the role of religion, magic, mystery, superstitions and faith became less prominent in society, and are replaced by more rational motives for acting. To explicate rationalization paradox which has a strong connection to 'differentiation', the concepts of pluralism and generalization need to be grasped. With the differentiation, the society is divided into many social units with a lot of reality and relative to each other. However, these units have to work at an efficient tempo in order to achieve their own goals, which has led to pluralism. Pluralization means people, groups and organizations ignoring the whole by hiding behind their political logic. Social units formed by differentiation need pluralism in this respect in order to achieve their goals. These units, which ignore the whole as a result of pluralization, need a new integrative perspective, and this is achieved by generalization. Generalized systems of culture, like popular culture, have an integrative and unifying power and offer a large-scale perspective to social units. As a result, the rationalization paradox brings with it both a narrowing of view and a widening of the view.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            In pre-modern society, the prevailing rule was to dominate nature only by obedience, but in modern society, the relationship between man and nature has changed significantly, and domestication has brought many transformations into our lives with the domestication of biological forces and the maximum use of nature's possibilities. While modernization envisages the independence of human beings from nature and culture on the axis of liberation, technological control has increased dependence on the system. Finally, the paradoxical character of domestication can be defined by the fact that during modernization, people began to feel increasingly independent from nature, but at the same time, their dependence on others and themselves increased.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Consequently, modernization does not have a straight development curve. On the contrary, it is a complex process that has ups and downs. And modernization will continue to surprise us with its paradoxes in the future, just as it has brought unexpected transformations in the past.

    <!-- Thinkathon is the sub-project of the
        assembly which gathers young people to discuss the cultural, economic,
        global problems and also the problems that youth of today is challenging
        and to talk the solutions that can be brought to them by the actions of
        young communities. Beyond that, the possible resolutions that today’s
        rule makers should  have for the discussed problems is being talked in
        the second step. The topic which is being discussed in this session are
        mostly related to the previous speech\ presentations. In the end of each
        session, the co-managers write down the highlights of the discussion and
        the resolutions which are found by the participants. The co-managers
        publish the notes that have been taken as the reports on the website
        ,which will be established soon, and also on the social platforms. -->
